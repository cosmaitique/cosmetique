           <p class="para"><span class="heading"> Hair Care </span> To summarize, when it comes to hair care, it's important to choose products that are specifically formulated for your hair type. Use a shampoo that removes excess oil and buildup for oily hair and a moisturizing shampoo for dry hair. Follow up with a conditioner to nourish and protect your hair, and use a hair mask once a week for an extra boost of hydration and strength. If you use heat styling tools, use a heat protectant spray to prevent damage, and to add shine and smoothness to your hair, try using a hair oil.</p>
